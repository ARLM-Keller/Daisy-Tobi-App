= Inception Phase Meeting 2 =

Note: this is the first face-to-face meeting of the architecture task-force.

== Dates ==

 * 2008-03-11 (Tuesday)
 * 2008-03-12 (Wednesday)

== Venue ==

Kindly hosted by DBB, in Copenhagen (Denmark).

== Participants ==

 * Ole Holst Andersen (DAISY)
 * Markus Gylling(DAISY)
 * Daniel Weck (DFA)
 * Stephen Hibberd (RNIB)
 * Romain Deltour (DAISY)

== Objectives ==

This 2-day session is a workshop, where participants interact in brainstorming mode.

The expected outcome is a draft specification of the main components of the application architecture for Tobi. The documentation produced will be available in this Wiki, in the usual [wiki:inception inception bucket]. 

Some preliminary material is available in the [wiki:inception/Requirements list of requirements] established so far. This list is a good starting point to conceptualize the low-level technical details of the application, but we may also expect to inject back some new functional objectives into the initial list.

== Agenda ==

=== DAY 1 ===

 * Markus to introduce the meeting's objectives and a reminder of his [wiki:inception/ArchitectureRationale technical write-up] about componentization and plugin-style architecture (modularization and extensibility).
 * Ole to talk about his role as the lead of this task force, and his C# experience of application frameworks.
 * Romain to present a selection of features from the RCP framework that are worth implementing for Tobi, and a brief overview of the main component model (an interactive demonstration of Eclipse would be great here).
 * Discussions and decisions about the Tobi architecture.
 * To rationalize in a structured way, maybe we should use mind-mapping (e.g. !FreeMind).
 * Daniel can take notes and feed the Wiki in live mode. Daniel can also quickly produce graphical diagrams, if it helps.

=== DAY 2 ===

 * Continuation of day 1.
 * Produce organized material to present as the formal outcome of this meeting.
 * Define the action plan for the next few weeks until the meeting at RNIB in April.
 * Ole to take responsibility for the conference calls. Define date for next Skype interaction.

== Core features ==

 * Runtime loading of executable code
 * Allow several versions of the same library to co-exist
 * Runtime discovery/selection of plugins - service repository
 * Exception handling (intercept propagation of exceptions from plugins)
 * Security - ensure that the plugins can not currupt the data model, file system, application state ect.

 * Online updates/discovery/download/installation

== Deployment features ==

 * Install/uninstall/upgrade/downgrade of plugins
 * Online deployment/upgrading 
 * Organization specific configuration (deployment server)
 * No requirement for a push architecture, but there is a requirement for the application instances to query the deployment servers for required upgrades/new plugins at startup and possibly at regular intervals.
 * Installation history - list of configurations, the ability to roll-back/revert to previous configuration.
 * Possibly a separate Update Manager application handling updates and configurations.
 * Running Tobi in safe-mode?

 * Tom !McCartney (RFBnD)

== Objectives ==

This 3-day meeting is an intense accelerated crash course about the Urakawa SDK and the Tobi project. The goal is to support Tom in rapidly gaining a good level of knowledge about the software architecture and design patterns we are using, so that we can work together efficiently in the weeks to come (mostly in remote mode). Tom will also provide feedback to Daniel about his experience of DAISY production (recording), within his organization.

=== DAY 1 ===

 * Presentations of roles/responsibilities + chat about Tom's organization projects and production processes/needs.
 * In-depth introduction to the Urakawa SDK data model (white board).
 * Use of Eclipse to browse the Java source and look at the design patterns in detail (event listener, visitor, navigator, factories, managers, etc.).
 * DAISY NCX / NCC navigation, challenges (e.g. page numbers in the middle of sentences), discussion about possible authoring metaphors.
 * Particular focus on the audio backend (media data "asset" management): practical exercise with the !DataProvider.copy() issue (Obi performance / lag problems).

= Specification of Authoring Workflow =

'''These notes are for brainstorming only, they are not meant to be used as a reference.'''

The starting point is often called "User Stories", where a top-to-bottom approach is used to describe a workflow in terms of actions (not requirements).

To goal is to describe possible scenarios (sequence of actions+results), from the user's perspective, in the form of a graph (with alternate paths depending on the decisions made throughout time). The graph describes all the possible execution scenarios (well, the ones that are relevant for defining implementation requirements), including going back to a previous action/state.

For example, using a (very limited) plain text format, with a hierarchical list (tree) to represent the decision paths: time is on the vertical axis (from top to bottom), a indentation to the right represents an alternative path, which can depend on a condition (decision following a user prompt, errors/exceptions, etc.). Here

 * [USER] creates a new full-text full-audio DAISY (DTD-aware) empty project (not from a template). [USER] specifies enclosing folder, name, metadata, is text/xml read-only or read-write, etc.
 * [USER] imports a single [FILE] from the local file system (drag and drop, or "open file" dialog).
   * @condition: [FILE] is DTBook
     * The application creates a [TEXT_DOCUMENT] representation within the authoring environment, based on the given file structure, without any synchronized audio content.
   * @condition: [FILE] is (x)HTML
     * The application attempts to create a [TEXT_DOCUMENT] representation within the authoring environment, based on the given file structure (by mapping content with the DTBook DTD), without any synchronized audio content. Any HTML tag that cannot be mapped to a DTBook DTD is indicated as "non DAISY XML", but appears in [TEXT_DOCUMENT] nonetheless.
 * [USER] points to (single click, or keyboard-based cursor navigation) a text fragment (section, title, etc.) in [TEXT_DOCUMENT].
 * [USER] selects (double-click or equivalent keyboard shortcut) the fragment to query the audio narration tool.
 * The recording panel is in focus, [USER] activates the recording feature.

= Tobi Plugin Examples =
This page contains descriptions of a series of developer-perspective examples of functionality/features that are added through a plugin/SOA framework. 

We need to aim for plugins being contributed using any of these patterns (in any combination):

 '''Plugins that replace existing functionality'''::
  Example: replace the existing VU-meter
 '''Plugins that refine existing functionality''':: 
  Equals the refinement of an existing plugin.
  Example: add a new "merge sections" method to a tree-based TOC Editor plugin
 '''Plugins that provide entirely new functionality'''::
  Example: add a noise reduction feature to an audio editor

== Adding a project annotation feature ==
 ''The developer will want to:''

 * Introduce "add anotation", "delete anotation" and "view annotation" actions, with activators (buttons) appearing in 1-n already existing(widgets) toolbars/menus;
 * When the add or view actions are invoked, pop a dialog that allows entering textual or audiotorial data;
 * When this dialog is closed, add this as a custom AnnotationProperty in the SDK tree;
 * Add a view that lists existing annotations and and allows navigating to presentation position, allows removing select annotations;
 * Show existing annotations as lines with a custom color in existing wave form view(s);
 * Add the add/delete/view actions to the context menu of the wave form view;
 * Persist the annotations at save project time;
 * Reinstantiate the annotations at project load time;
 * Add an "Export Annotations as Zed Bookmark File" action appearing in application main menu bar File;

== Adding a physical-level audio manipulation feature ==
(think noise reduction)
 ''The developer will want to:''

 * Be able to define a wizard, and give access to it in existing menus. Used to noise-reduce sets of files in one batch operation;
 * Get access to current selection in a wave view;
 * Get access to action population of local menus/context menus in relevant views (where a shortcut "noise reduce current selection" appears);
 * Get access to assett management to get/replace wave assets

== Adding support for the remote control Sony RCS-2 mkIII ==
 ''The developer will want to:''
 * Append a new tab "remote control setup" to the existing configuration dialog;
 * Get read access to application state (recording, playing, paused, etc);
 * Get access to application state modification (start recording, stop recording, play, etc);
 * Get access to presentation (SDK tree navigation) features (next, previous, first, last, ff, rew)

== Adding support for a new Save As option ==
 ''The developer will want to:''
 * Append a new Save As XYZ to the existing File menu item in the main application menu;
 * Be able to pop an options dialog/options wizard that is invoked by the save as XYZ action;
 * Get access to the SDK data tree when serializing.

This Trac environment is provided by CVS-Dude. A few additional services come with this hosting solution. To optimize your workflow, you may want to bookmark some of the following links.

 * ...and a direct link: [https://node8.cvsdude.com/login.pl]

== RSS feeds ==

Any modern web-browser should show a feed icon when a Trac page contains an RSS feed.

Here are direct links:

 * Blog: [http://node11.cvsdude.com/tracrss/daisy/tobi/blog?format=rss]
 * Wiki (also received the Blog updates): [http://node11.cvsdude.com/tracrss/daisy/tobi/timeline?wiki=on&max=50&daysback=90&format=rss]
 * Timeline (any of Wiki, SVN commits, Tickets and Milestone changes): [http://node11.cvsdude.com/tracrss/daisy/tobi/timeline?format=rss]
 * Active Tickets: [http://node11.cvsdude.com/tracrss/daisy/tobi/report/1?format=rss]
 * All Tickets: [http://node11.cvsdude.com/tracrss/daisy/tobi/report/6?format=rss]
 * Revision Log ("/" root of the repository): [http://node11.cvsdude.com/tracrss/daisy/tobi/log/?limit=100&mode=stop_on_copy&format=rss]
 * Revision Log (for "/first_commit-test.html"): [http://node11.cvsdude.com/tracrss/daisy/tobi/log/first_commit-test.html?limit=100&mode=stop_on_copy&format=rss]

Although it's not useful right now, there are authenticated feeds. For the sake of keeping records of links, here's an example with the Blog:

 * Secure HTTPS: [https://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/rss/tobi/blog?format=rss]
 * Plain HTTP: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/rss/tobi/blog?format=rss]
 * Secure HTTPS: [https://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/blog?format=rss]
 * Plain HTTP: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/blog?format=rss]

== Advanced ==

 * It is worth noting that there is a direct mapping between the AdminUpload -> Upload List directory and a public URL. For example: [http://PROJECT-trac.cvsdude.com/MODULE/chrome/uploads/USER/file.ext] is actually stored inside "/var/www/cvsdude/trac/PROJECT/MODULE/uploads/USER/", which is a write-enabled folder for authenticated TRAC_ADMIN users.

 * There is also the "/var/www/cvsdude/trac/PROJECT/MODULE/templates/" directory, but it's used internally by the Trac runtime only, there is no public HTTP URL to access its contents. The configuration also shows "/usr/local/python/share/trac/templates".

 * The CSS and JS files are in the "chrome" directory, e.g.: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/common/css/wiki.css] and [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/common/js/trac.js]. For built-in plugins, there are separate chrome folders, e.g.: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/blog/css/blog.css] and [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/tags/css/tractags.css] and [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/admin/css/admin.css]

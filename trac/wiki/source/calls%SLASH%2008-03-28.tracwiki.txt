== Objectives ==

The [wiki:calls/2008-03-07 previous call] kick-started Ole's lead in the architecture task-force (just before the Copenhagen face-to-face meeting), so we re-distributed tasks a little bit. This objective of this conference call is to check on everybody's progress (use-cases analysis, requirements gathering, plugin-related experimentation work).

== Agenda ==

Action items from the [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/wiki/calls/2008-03-07#ActionItems previous call].

 1. Stephen to talk about his .NET 3.5 Addin experimentations (#15).
 2. Mockups / UI-prototype: discuss action plan to deliver tangible proof-of-concept by the [wiki:meetings/2008-04-07 Peterborough meeting].
 3. Use-cases / stories: can we make the analysis in the D3PT-reqs more specific to Tobi, and deliver implementable, well-scoped scenarios ? (to break-down objectives and costs for planning future iterations).
 4. Anything else ?

== Minutes ==

The numbered list below matches the agenda above.

 1. Summary: interesting and working solution of plug/unplug of core functionality, good security model and exception handling, but more work required with UI side of things (WPF, which is 3.5 only, and a bit slow apparently). New task: get hands-on SVN (e.g. Tortoise and AkhSVN), add C# code into the /inception/plugin/addin/. Daniel gave a quick-and-dirty crash-course about SVN commands and typical folder organization (trunk, tag, branches). Another task is to use the Wiki to drop ideas, even if things are likely to be dropped.
 2. We need to focus on the added-value that Tobi provides for end-users (avoid re-inventing the wheel by presenting a proof-of-concept that looks more or less like Dolphin/other product). Stephen to deliver a multi-perspective UI with basic views and widget layout. At this 
 3. Missing participants on the call: we have to skip this item. Daniel will work-out a minimum set of documents for the April deliverable.
 4. Stephen is looking at Obi's code to extract valuable design patterns and/or implementations that we should consider in Tobi. Daniel explained how to build, with Urakawa-SDK and !AudioBackend sub-project. Other small point: the page for [milestone:Phase%201] has been improved, to include a list of current active issues (to be resolved).

== Action Items ==

 * Continued: DANIEL: finish polishing-out the [wiki:inception/Requirements requirements list]. Package deliverable for milestone [milestone:Phase%201].
 * Continued: #20 STEPHEN on C#.NET GUI prototyping (!WinForms).
 * Continued: #15 STEPHEN on .NET Addin experimentation (added task: SVN checkout and commit, to keep track).

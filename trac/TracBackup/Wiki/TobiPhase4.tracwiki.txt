'''1st October 2008 - 1st January 2009'''

(previous: [wiki:TobiPhase3 Phase 3], next: [wiki:TobiPhase5 Phase 5])

== Tobi stage 1 (text but poor audio) ==

=== Description of Deliverable ===

 * Installable and usable barebone application, with synchronized text and audio views.
 * The application implements at least one method to select and edit text, at the structure and at the character level.
 * Audio display (i.e. waveform blocks) should be used to represent text/audio synchronization, but it is not required to be editable (record or edit functions). There is basically no complex requirement for audio at this stage (e.g. zoom in/out), but playback would be a bonus feature.
 * Sample content must be provided to facilitate testing by users. At this stage, there is no requirement for the supported format (i.e. can be XUK or DAISY 3/DTBook). The emphasis should be on opening existing content, not on creating content from scratch.
 * High-level documentation must be written to explain how to use the application, and its limitations (John).
 * Some time must be allocated to evaluate the (albeit simple) editing process offered by this initial release (John+David).

=== Remarks ===

 * This is the start of the active development work (i.e. the end of the inception period). From this point onwards, proper Scrum process management must take place. Prioritization of the "Product Backlog" must be done by the "Product Owner" (i.e. DAISY / Markus). Iteration planning is based on the realization of the "Sprint Backlog". The process should remain light at this stage, therefore the use of metrics for refining estimates is not required (i.e. "Burndown Graph").

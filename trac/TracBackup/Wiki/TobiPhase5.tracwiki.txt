'''1st January 2009 - 1st April 2009'''

(previous: [wiki:TobiPhase4 Phase 4], next: [wiki:TobiPhase6 Phase 6])

== Tobi stage 2 (better text, more audio) ==

=== Description of Deliverable ===

 * This is a continuation of the previous phase, with increased emphasis on audio editing.
 * Basic audio recording ability is required, as well as simple split and merge. Fine-grained audio selection is not required at this stage, as well as complex audio processing features (e.g. phrase detection, normalization, etc.).
 * Text editing is improved based on feedback from previous phase.

=== Remarks ===

 * Adjustments to the management process may be required based on the experience from the previous phase.

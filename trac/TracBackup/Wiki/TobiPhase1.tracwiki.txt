= Phase 1 =

'''1st January 2008 - 1st April 2008'''

(next: [wiki:TobiPhase2 Phase 2])

__Note:__ the following [A] and [B] sections are '''2 independent parallel tracks''', which are both continued into the next phase.


== [A] Tobi requirements gathering, usability study (first part, continued in next phase) ==

=== Description of Deliverable ===

 * Graphical User Interface mockups (images+descriptions and/or real executable UI).
 * Authoring workflow (initial formal specification).
 * Addendum to the DAISY 3 Production Tool Requirements (D3PT) (system integration, installation/maintenance procedures, input/output devices, multi-user / multi-faceted interface, accessibility, production workflow, etc.).

|| ''Ole Holst Andersen'' || DAISY || '''0.1''' || Also allocated in track B ||
|| ''Markus Gylling'' || DAISY || '''0.1''' || Reviews reports and coordinates actions ||

== [B] XML text support in SDK (first part, continued in next phase) ==

=== Description of Deliverable ===

 * Updates to SDK design (Java) and implementation (C#), in order to offer preliminary support (read-only) for XML and text (i.e. DTBook).
 * Evaluation of design efficiency based on large text samples (i.e. for DTBook content parsing and navigation).
 * Simple Graphical User Interface for testing a Model View Controller architecture and the built-in event framework from the SDK (e.g. several tree widgets displaying different fragments of the document).

=== Remarks ===

 * The goal of the UI implementation work is to help drive the design activity forward (data model and API). The produced GUI concepts may be retained in the actual Tobi application, but the GUI implementation itself may potentially be thrown away at later stage (because of the choice of technical framework and GUI toolkit). The UI implementation should therefore be minimal (keep things simple for demonstration purposes only). The emphasis must be put on producing a full-featured backend.

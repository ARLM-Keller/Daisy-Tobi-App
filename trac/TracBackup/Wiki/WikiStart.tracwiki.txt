= Welcome to Tobi's home ! =

== What is the Tobi project ? ==

A 2-fold governing strategy:

 1. Provide a fully-fledged '''interactive authoring tool''' for DAISY accessible multimedia formats, focusing on the editing/recording workflow of full-text full-audio Digital Talking Books (with support for NIMAS/NISO DTBook XML).
 2. Provide a '''modular and extensible application framework''' designed to facilitate third-party software integration (plugins) and vendor-specific customizations (re-packaging).

Key characteristics:

 * '''Free open-source''' software, released under a business-friendly licensing scheme ([wiki:LGPLvsBSD LGPL]) that encourages commercial exploitation.
 * Created by the '''DAISY Consortium''', maintained in collaboration with several key partners including as the Nippon Foundation (Japan) and RNIB (United Kingdom).
 * Will reach mature status at the end of the 2.5 years charter term, but frequent deliverables are planned during this timeframe.

'''DAISY''' (Digital Accessible Information SYstem) is an '''open standard''' for accessible electronic multimedia.

The [http://daisy.org DAISY Consortium] is a worldwide body of like-minded organizations collaborating to develop the standards and to implement strategies for the production, exchange and use of next-generation Digital Talking Books (DTB) aimed at people who are '''blind''', '''visually-impaired''', or otherwise '''print-disabled''' (e.g. dyslexic).

The DAISY Consortium is a non-profit organization.

The [http://urakawa.sf.net/ Urakawa project] is the incubator for the Tobi project, and is itself hosted under the DAISY Consortium umbrella. The project currently lives at Sourceforge.net (source code SVN repository, documentation and public web-site).

The Urakawa project delivers a software stack of which the core is the SDK (Software Development Toolkit). Several applications are developed around this toolkit, the most mature being [http://urakawa.sf.net/ Obi]. Tobi also relies on the SDK, although the software is in inception stage only (see below).

== Current Status, Roadmap ==

Tobi is in its '''inception''' phase, at the stage where a formal '''requirements gathering''' process is taking place. The goal is to produce a prioritized hierarchy of functional/integration/etc. requirements, a series of user-interface mockups with a strong emphasis on the authoring workflow, and a GUI prototype to demonstrate look and feel.

A second separate track is taking place in parallel: the objective is to write the formal specifications of Tobi's modular and extensible application framework (following the plugin model).

For detailed information about the action plan, please check the [wiki:TobiRoadmap roadmap].

Currently, most of the produced material ends-up in this [wiki:inception inception "bucket"]. Process tracking and reporting is available in the [wiki:meetings meeting reports] and [wiki:calls conference call minutes]. The agenda of upcoming events is available [wiki:agenda here].

== Getting Started ==

This online collaborative environment ("Trac") is primarily targeted at authenticated developers. However, anonymous visitors are granted read-only credentials to browse this website freely.

The environment provides:

 * a '''Wiki''' (you're reading it now).
 * a comment-enabled '''Blog''' (which is in fact a sub-part of the Wiki).
 * a '''Tag''' categorization system, to keep things organized.
 * an '''Issue Tracker''', which registers '''Tickets''' for Requests For Enhancement, Bugs, etc.
 * an '''SVN''' repository, with full support for concurrent access, visual diffs, revision browser, commit mailing-lists, etc.
 * a '''Roadmap''' section, to plan project Milestones and track progress, based on information from the Issue Tracker.
 * a '''Timeline''' of changes that occur here, to stay up-to-date.

The entire environment is searchable and provides RSS notifications (see below).

=== Keeping up-to-date ===

The best way to stay informed is by using the built-in RSS feeds. Any modern web-browser should support news feeds natively, and of course there are many news-readers available.

For example, the "Timeline" section (only available to authenticated users) produces an RSS feed that notifies any change that happens in the Trac environment (Wiki, Tickets, SVN commit, milestones, etc.). For more information on how to use Trac (and direct links to RSS feeds), please read the section below.

The Tobi project currently does not have a public mailing-list.

=== Getting help ===

The original Trac welcome page is [wiki:TracWelcomePage available here]. Follow the links to learn how to use Trac.

We have added our remarks regarding accessibility, and more particularly the issue of [AccessKeys access keys] (keyboard shortcuts).

You can also check [wiki:CvsDudeLinks this bookmark page] for useful pointers, such as direct hyperlinks to RSS feeds, etc.

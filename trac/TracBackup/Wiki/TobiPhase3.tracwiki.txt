= Phase 3 =

'''1st July 2008 - 1st October 2008'''

(previous: [wiki:TobiPhase2 Phase 2], next: [wiki:TobiPhase4 Phase 4])

__Note:__ this phase is actually shorter than 3 months, because of the typically slow summer holiday season in Europe.


== Technical study and election of programming language + application framework ==

=== Description of Deliverable ===

 * Final decision for Tobi's programming language and application framework. The current assumption is that this will be the same as the existing SDK implementation and Obi (i.e. C#.NET). However, some issues need to be investigated thoroughly to ensure the technical choice is optimal for the task at hand.
 * Formal rationale for the decision: this will be the formal document to backup the decision and to describe how the consensus is reached.
 * In case it is decided to make a port from the current C# implementation to another language, it is estimated that the associated cost (including testing) should not be more than 10 working days with 2 FTE developers. This load may need to be offset onto the next phase, requiring additional planning.

=== Remarks ===

 * This activity includes a feasibility study and some prototyping with various candidate technologies.
 * The criteria to evaluate include audio latency, availability of plugin/modular framework, online update mechanism, rich-text WYSIWYG widget support, XML processing libraries, etc. The previous 2 phases have already produced sufficient requirements data to support this work.

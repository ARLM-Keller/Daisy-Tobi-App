== Objectives ==

This is a follow-up of the previous face-to-face meeting: [wiki:meetings/2008-02-14].

The expected outcome of this conference call is a date for the next meeting date at RNIB (sometime in April, joint Tobi / Pipeline).

== Preparatory Information ==

 * Daniel Weck: Not available between 1-6 April.
 * Stephen Hibberd: unavailable 21-25 April inclusive.
 * Markus Gylling: Not available 14-17 April (?)

== Agenda ==

 1. Comments about last face-to-face meeting (Markus was unfortunately unable to attend, he will be at the next meeting though).
 2. Cross-check April agendas, find a suitable date.
 3. Minor logistical task: find cheaper accommodation for 4 (hotel flat ?)
 4. Any other issue (e.g. collaborative wiki, calendar ?)

== Minutes ==

 * Agreed on date for next face-to-face meeting (joint Tobi/Pipeline): Monday 7, Tuesday 8 April 2008, RNIB (Peterborough).
 * Decided that a fully-fledged Google Calendar was not required. Instead, an "Agenda" Wiki page will suffice.
 * Decided that internal RNIB Tobi/Pipeline team mailing-lists were required, but without archive facility. Instead, Tobi team will extract essence of email discussions and organize into relevant Wiki pages. Pipeline team will use SF.net mailing-lists archives.

== Action Items ==

 * '''DONE, see here: [wiki:calls]''' (Daniel): add Skype contact-list in Trac Wiki (publicly-available, but not a big issue thanks to the protocol for accepting contacts)
 * '''DONE, see here: [wiki:agenda]''' (Daniel): add chronological agenda in Trac Wiki (no need for fully-fledged shared Google calendar, a list of upcoming and past events is sufficient for now)

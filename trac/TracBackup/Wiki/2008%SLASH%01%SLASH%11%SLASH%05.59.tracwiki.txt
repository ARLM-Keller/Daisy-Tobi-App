= Email Notifications =
I have enabled email notifications in the Tobi Trac environment (for tickets and wiki).
By posting this blog message I should receive an email.
Let's see...
(I wonder if logged users can "watch" and "un/watch" a wiki page or a set of pages ?)

Well, things are not quite working the way I want them to, but at least Ticket notification seems to work fine.

Wiki notification seems to be inactive on this CVS-Dude setup.

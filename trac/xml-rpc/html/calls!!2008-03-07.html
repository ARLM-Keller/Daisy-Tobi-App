The <a href="calls!!2008-02-29.html" title="">previous call</a> was mainly about logistics, so not much progress was made then. The goal now is to overcome the challenges of multi-organization remote collaboration and to put some velocity into the project.
</p><p>
The preparation task for this conference call was to review the existing <a href="inception!!Requirements.html" title="">requirements?</a> and come-up with ideas for improvements (additions and alterations). For example, categories need some re-organization, and there are missing requirements in several buckets.
</p><h2 id="Agenda">Agenda</h2><p>
Any action items from the <a href="calls!!2008-02-29.html" title="">previous call</a> ?
</p><p>
Go through the <a href="inception!!Requirements.html" title="">list of requirements?</a> and re-organize things around to make it more readable. One suggestion is to break it down into several pages, one for each major area. This categorization may not be suitable for requirements that seem to belong to more than one area, but the goal is indeed to disambiguate topics so that the translation to actual development goals is straight-forward. Simpler is better. 
</p><h2 id="Minutes">Minutes</h2><p>
3 main topics:
</p><ol><li>Requirements
</li><li>Authoring Workflow / User Stories
</li><li>Mockups, GUI prototypes
</li></ol><p>
We agree that reqs need to be re-organized because the current document lacks readability. We now have a baseline set of requirements derived from prior art / knowledge on the subject, and collective gathering. However the top-down approach using User-Stories needs to be developed further, we need to go back to basics in terms of analysis of user needs: D3PT user-cases. This will provide the last batch of requirements and more importantly a better workflow structure. We agree that GUI programming is best handled by 1 person only (or primarily), with occasional contribution for well-scope actions by other team members. Stephen can take-on this role (starting with quick-prototyping using Visual Studio 2005 WinForms C#.NET). Daniel and Stephen to allocate some time to talk about GUI design in Copenhagen next week. Mockup design can be more time-consuming than rapid GUI development, so less emphasis from David and John on this.
</p><h2 id="ActionItems">Action Items</h2><ul><li>DANIEL: sort (prioritize) and re-organize <a href="inception!!Requirements.html" title="">existing list?</a>. Cross-check with D3PT-reqs that apply to Tobi.
</li><li>OLE: focus on Architecture from now on: <a href="TobiPhase1.html" title="">Track B of the roadmap</a>. Less important role in Track A. Read (and update) Markus' original <a href="inception!!architecture!!PluginRationale.html" title="">architecture document</a>. More discussions in Copenhagen next week.

</li><li>DAVID and JOHN: read the D3PT <a href="TobiDaisyProdToolReqs.html" title="">use cases</a> that relate to Tobi, in order to flesh them out into User Stories that we can use to formally describe Authoring Workflow. e.g. DTBook is master is likely the most important user-case for Tobi, out of the total 10 use-cases.

We are not using a mailing-list archives to avoid find-hell. Instead, we expect participants in an email discussion to take care of extracting the essence of the conversation and to organize it in relevant sections of the Wiki. A collaborative Wiki is a flexible yet powerful way of managing brainstorming and decision-making content, so we want to maximize its use.

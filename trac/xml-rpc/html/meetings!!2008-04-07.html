This 2-day meeting is essentially an interactive brainstorming session. The format is the same as the <a href="meetings!!2008-02-14.html" title="">previous meeting</a> at RNIB.
</p><p>
This time however, we have reached (or are reaching) our <a href="TobiPhase1.html" title="">first major milestone</a> for year 2008. I suggest that we use this meeting as the official event to close this initial milestone.
</p><p>
We can look in retrospect at the work done and at the challenges encountered to make this cross-organization remote collaboration work, not only in terms of logistics but also in terms of creating momentum, keeping everyone interested, getting velocity in key areas, distributing action items, basically: using the human resources in the most effective way.
</p><p>
Second, we must define the key objectives for this second and final major iteration on the requirements gathering, mockup design and in addition: actual prototyping (real executable UI). By the summer, we need a complete product specification for Tobi and we can then close the inception period to enter design and implementation phase.
</p><blockquote>
<p>
Reminder of the why this deliverable is important:
</p>
</blockquote><p>
  
</p><blockquote>
<p>
The focus will need to be on prioritization of the functional requirements inside the so-called "Product Backlog", which is a term for the entire application specification to be implemented (Scrum is the agile development process we are using to manage the Tobi software project, thus the specific terminology).
</p>
</blockquote><p>
  
</p><blockquote>
<p>
At implementation stage, this product configuration will incrementally be broken-down into successive 1-month development iterations (called "Sprints"), each of which will consist in realizing the so-called "Sprint Backlog". In other words, the Product Backlog is gradually "emptied" by translating requirements into concrete programming tasks for each iteration (Sprint Backlog).
</p>
</blockquote><p>
  
</p><blockquote>
<p>
To summarize, the prioritized items in the Product Backlog define the order of deliverables in the implementation process. Everyone must agree on what matters more in the early alpha and beta stages.
</p>

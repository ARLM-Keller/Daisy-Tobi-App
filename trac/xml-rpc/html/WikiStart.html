<h1 id="Homepage">Homepage</h1><h2 id="BriefOverview">Brief Overview</h2><p>
Tobi is a next-generation production tool for accessible multimedia formats such as DAISY-3 digital talking books (open standard otherwise known as <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005</span></a>). Tobi is currently under heavy development, with a first public beta release slated for the end of August 2009 and a first stable release (version 1.0) planned for January 2010. Tobi will offer an intuitive audio recording workflow for full-text digital talking books, with support for rich <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/structure/"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">DTBook document markup</span></a>, the XML open-standard currently used by DAISY, NIMAS and ePub (the emerging e-book industry standard).

</p><p>
Tobi is available at no charge, and is <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">free open-source software</span></a> distributed under a <a href="LGPLvsBSD.html" title="">business-friendly license</a> (i.e. a scheme that permits commercial usage and modifications whilst protecting the original developers' work). Tobi's modular software architecture will allow the development of third-party plugins, which reduces development costs and encourages community effort. The goal is to enable the overall long-term sustainability of the <a href="inception!!architecture!!EcoSystem.html" title="">application ecosystem</a>.
</p><p>
Tobi is designed and implemented by the DAISY Consortium collaboratively with international partners, including the Nippon Foundation (Japan), RFB&amp;D (USA) and RNIB (United Kingdom). Application installers will be provided from the time of the first beta release (end of August 2009) and onwards. In the meantime, the source code is available for everyone to compile and run. Developers and organizations are welcome to <a href="ContactUs.html" title="">contact us</a> if they wish to contribute and/or participate.
</p><p>
The beta builds will be provided for testing purposes. During this public testing phase, we aim at stabilizing the application (i.e. fixing bugs). The plan is to release a stable version of Tobi in January 2010, which will be the first production-ready deliverable. The target feature set is described <a href="inception!!requirements!!UniqueSellingPoints.html" title="">here</a>. The detailed project roadmap is available <a href="TobiRoadmap.html" title="">here</a>.
</p><p>
Note: behind the scenes, Tobi utilizes the <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/urakawa-sdk"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Urakawa SDK</span></a> (Software Development Kit).

Due to its projected size and complexity, Tobi is an advanced project that requires state-of-the-art software technologies. The long-term ambitions for this project mean that we needed to be forward-thinking in terms of computer performance and software design. One of the project's goals was also to reach a large user and programmer community for the development of an open ecosystem.
</p><p>
The Tobi application is written with Visual Studio 2008 in the C# language for the Microsoft .NET framework. These are currently Windows-only technologies, which is a limitation that we hope will be removed with the advent of the cross-platform <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://www.mono-project.com"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Mono framework</span></a>.
</p><p>
The application front-end is made with the <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://www.codeplex.com/wpf"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Windows Presentation Foundation</span></a> (WPF), which is a mature technology in the .NET 3 series. WPF not only provides a great user experience, it also enable designers and programmers to enjoy modern user-interface construction, where separation of concerns is key to the maintainability and testability of a software product.
</p><p>
WPF utilizes an enhanced accessibility model called <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms747327.aspx"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">UI-Automation</span></a>, which is supported by modern screen readers. WPF is based on hardware-accelerated scalable graphics, which means that magnification for users with vision impairments is crisp and detailed. WPF also supports graphical themes to meet accessibility requirements or simply to suit user tastes.
</p><p>
Although Tobi will be nearly entirely built upon the modern WPF technology, it will also be fully compatible with the traditional MFC-inherited UI development model, namely: Windows-Forms. This way, Tobi will enable organizations and developers to use legacy code for their contributions. As a matter of fact, Tobi will be re-using code coming from DAISY's own <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/obi"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Obi application</span></a>, which is built on the .NET 2 series. In addition, WPF doesn't preclude crossing the boundaries into the unmanaged world, which means that fast native code can be used for processing-intensive routines or low-level access to the operating system.
</p><p>
The Tobi project relies on several open-source technologies, including <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono.Addins"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Mono.Addin</span></a> and the <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Composite Application Guidance</span></a> for WPF. These libraries play key roles in Tobi's modular architecture, as summarized in <a href="inception!!architecture!!EcoSystem.html" title="">this diagram</a>.
</p><p>
PS: the cross-platform <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://silverlight.net"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Silverlight</span></a> browser technology is a subset of WPF, so there is some overlap in terms of development tools and methods. An interesting project in that respect is the <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://www.eclipse4sl.org"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Eclipse Silverlight plugin</span></a>. It is worth noting that there is a Silverlight-based DAISY player called <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://www.buttercupreader.net"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Buttercup</span></a>.

<i>Overview</i>
</p><p>
The Urakawa project is an incubator created and maintained by the DAISY Consortium, with key support from international partners such as the NRCD (Japan), the INRIA (France) and CWI (Netherlands). The software deliverables of the Urakawa project consist of a software suite including the SDK (Software Development Toolkit), <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://urakawa.sf.net/obi"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Obi</span></a> and <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Tobi</span></a>.
</p><p>
The Urakawa project was originally hosted at <a xmlns="" class="ext-link" href="http://urakawa.sourceforge.net"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="icon">Sourceforge.net Sourceforge</span></a>, but that site is now obsolete as we have moved our development resources to this new Trac-based collaborative environment. The original website is kept as a legacy placeholder, which is deprecated and won't be maintained.

<i>History</i>
</p><img src="http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/uploads/daniel-weck/UrakawaLogo.png" title="Urakawa logo" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/><p>
The Urakawa project logo is a circle that contains a large symbolic sea wave, to commemorate the birth of the project in a town called "Urakawa", in Hokkaido (nothern Japan). Urakawa-town has been the setting of devastating tsunamis, and its population has gathered an experience that is now being shared through training and oral communication. The people of Urakawa-town are forward-thinkers who have become volunteers to take part in a large research and experimentation programme for the inclusion of ICT (Information Communication Technology) in evacuation training. Interactive multimedia is a key contributor to the success of disaster preparedness projects, as it meets the needs of a broad category of end-users that have unequal access to safety information. Training manuals produced in accessible DAISY Digital Talking Books are helping not only the print-disabled or visually-impaired, but also persons with various degrees of socio-cognitive disabilities such as the elderly and people with autism. In this era of information society, the DAISY Consortium is dedicated to provide free production and playback tools so that everyone can contribute regardless of their purchasing power.

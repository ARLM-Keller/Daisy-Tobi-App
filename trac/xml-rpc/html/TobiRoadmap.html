<h1 id="TobiRoadmap">Tobi Roadmap</h1><h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2><p>
Tobi is an ambitious software project, with a a relatively aggressive schedule of 2/2.5 years to reach mature state (stable and complete feature set).
</p><p>
The proposed roadmap spans from January 2008 to January 2010, and is (hopefully) an efficient development program covering inception, design and implementation.
</p><p>
Please note that in this plan, the objectives from April 2009 onwards are intentionally under-specified. The rationale is that circumstances may (and probably will) change: product requirements, resources, industry-standards, etc. We will re-assess goals and resources nearer the time.
</p><h2 id="ObjectivesProjectPlan">Objectives, Project Plan</h2><p>
The project plan is available in Trac format, in the <a href="http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/roadmap" title="">"Roadmap" section</a>. Alternatively, the milestones and their full deliverable specifications are directly accessible <a href="TobiPhase1.html" title="">here</a>.
</p><p>
The staffing requirements are specified for each milestone. In addition, an overall staffing plan is available <a href="StaffingPlan.html" title="">here</a>.

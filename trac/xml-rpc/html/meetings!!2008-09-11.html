This 3-day meeting is an intense accelerated crash course about the Urakawa SDK and the Tobi project. The goal is to support Tom in rapidly gaining a good level of knowledge about the software architecture and design patterns we are using, so that we can work together efficiently in the weeks to come (mostly in remote mode). Tom will also provide feedback to Daniel about his experience of DAISY production (recording), within his organization.

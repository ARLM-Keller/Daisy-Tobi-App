= Improved Looks =
I have introduced a few CSS tweaks and fixes in a custom site_css.cs file, so now this Trac instance is a little bit easier on the eyes. The logo credits go to Julien (cute bird riding an elephant).

Everything is tentative or temporary at this stage, the goal of this small update is essentially to get rid of the ugly red+black color scheme of the default Trac install.

Comments are welcome (below).

The attached file is a copy of the ClearSilver file that is effectively used by this Trac instance. It is provided as a courtesy, for the curious souls out-there :) (the entire Trac default CSS style should be overridden to use em instead of px, really...)

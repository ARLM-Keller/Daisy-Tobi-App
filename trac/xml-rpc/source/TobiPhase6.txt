= Phase 6 =

'''1st April 2009 - 1st July 2009'''

(previous: [wiki:TobiPhase5 Phase 5], next: [wiki:TobiPhase7 Phase 7])

== Tobi stage 3 ==

=== Description of Deliverable ===

 * Support for various document types and XML extensions. Improved import/export functionality. Concrete goals will depend on Z-next developments (reference implementation). Integration with Pipeline services is likely (interoperable distribution and authoring formats).
 * At this stage, the application remains organization-agnostic, with a single generic packaging/deployment method, and a fixed set of plugins (extension modules).

=== Remarks ===

 * Objectives and description of deliverable are intentionally under-specified. Refinements will be provided as progress is made through the previous increments.

= Roadmap Overview =

== Major Milestones ==

=== 1st July 2008 ===

 * final outcome of requirements gathering: formal specifications for workflow, UI usability/accessibility, system integration, etc. and demonstration prototypes + GUI mockups.
 * first non-draft release of the core architecture specifications (modular, extensible, plugin-based design).

=== 1st October 2008 ===

 * draft implementation of the core application architecture, including the required design updates in the Urakawa SDK.
 * feasibility study: formal specification of resource requirements, to be considered as a guarantee of project completion under the current timeframe.

=== 1st January 2009 ===

 * first ''public'' application deliverable: focused on rudimentary text/structure authoring, with some basic audio recording and playback facility.

=== 1st April 2009 ===

 * second ''public'' deliverable: improved text/structure authoring, and better support for audio recording and editing. This should be considered as the baseline (in terms of features) for full-text / full-audio DAISY/NISO Z39.86 authoring. Tobi is distributed as a single package that is organization-agnostic.

=== Onwards ===

 * support for Z-Next.
 * integration with Pipeline format conversion services.
 * implementation of organization-specific deployment requirements, such as for CD/remote-drive installation, online updates, workflow documentation, etc.
 * integration of third-party (vendor-provided) plugins, to enhance or add functionality to the baseline authoring tool.
 * online platform for supporting plugin development and documentation.

== Process Summary ==

 * The allocated timeframe (2.5 years) is divided into a number of "phases", each consisting in 3 calendar months. At the end of each phase, a major milestone is reached and a public announcement is made (at a large scale, via the DAISY communication infrastructure).
 * Each 3-months "phase" is divided into 3 increments of equal length. These are iterations that lead to internal test releases, so public announcements at a wide scale are not required. The whole process is open though, which means that anyone can access the published binaries and documents at any time. They just can't expect any support from the core team.
 * Objectives are intentionally under-specified for phases that are too far into the future. User demands and developer requirements may change over time, so in order to adapt, we are planning and tracking each iteration under the rules of an agile development process.

== Reporting, Documentation ==

The Tobi project is managed online using a collaborative tool called "Trac". Authenticated developers have write-credentials whereas anonymous visitors have limited access to relevant information only. Although this site's services are primarily targeted at developers, it is a good place for end-users too (documentation, progress tracking, RSS feeds, bug reporting, etc.).

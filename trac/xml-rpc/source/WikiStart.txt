Tobi is '''Free''' and '''[http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php Open-Source]''' software, released under a business-friendly licensing scheme ([wiki:LGPLvsBSD LGPL]) that encourages commercial exploitation.

The project was initiated by the '''DAISY Consortium''', but is maintained in collaboration with several key partners including as the Nippon Foundation (Japan) and RNIB (United Kingdom).

The software project has a 2-fold governing strategy:

 1. Provide an off-the-shelf fully-fledged '''interactive authoring tool''' for DAISY accessible multimedia formats, focusing on the editing/recording workflow of full-text full-audio Digital Talking Books (with support for NIMAS DTBook XML and DAISY 3-2005 aka ANSI/NISO Z39.86).
 2. Provide a '''modular and extensible application framework''' designed to facilitate third-party software integration (plugins) and vendor-specific customizations (re-packaging).

The project is currently moving towards the end of its inception period (requirements gathering and basic design drafts). The high-level requirements of Tobi are now available [wiki:inception/requirements/UniqueSellingPoints here].

We expect a production-ready deliverable within 2.5 years of implementation effort, but frequent public releases are planned throughout the open development process.

The detailed project roadmap is available [wiki:TobiRoadmap here]. Process tracking and reporting is available in the [wiki:meetings meeting reports] and [wiki:calls conference call minutes]. The agenda of upcoming events is available [wiki:agenda here].

'''DAISY''' (Digital Accessible Information SYstem) is an '''open standard''' for accessible electronic multimedia.

The [http://daisy.org DAISY Consortium] is a worldwide body of like-minded organizations collaborating to develop the standards and to implement strategies for the production, exchange and use of next-generation Digital Talking Books (DTB) aimed at people who are '''blind''', '''visually-impaired''', or otherwise '''print-disabled''' (e.g. dyslexic).

The DAISY Consortium is a non-profit organization.

The [http://urakawa.sf.net/ Urakawa project] is the incubator for several projects (including Tobi), and is itself maintained under the DAISY Consortium umbrella. The Urakawa project website is currently hosted at at Sourceforge.net.

The core deliverable of the Urakawa project is the Urakawa-SDK (Software Development Toolkit). Several applications are currently being developed around this toolkit, the most mature being [http://urakawa.sf.net/ Obi]. Tobi will also be based on the SDK.

== Getting Started ==

This website is an online collaborative environment named "Trac", which is primarily targeted at developers (authenticated with their login). Anonymous visitors can freely browse the information on this website, but they are granted read-only credentials.

This Trac environment provides:

 * a '''Wiki''' (you're reading it now).
 * a comments-enabled '''Blog'''.
 * a '''Tag''' categorization system, to keep things organized.
 * an '''Issue Tracker''', which registers '''Tickets''' for Requests For Enhancement, Bugs, etc.
 * an '''SVN''' repository, with full support for concurrent access, visual diffs, revision browser, commit mailing-lists, etc.
 * a '''Roadmap''' section, to plan project Milestones and track progress, based on information from the Issue Tracker.
 * a '''Timeline''' of changes that occur here, to stay up-to-date.

The entire environment is searchable.

=== Keeping up-to-date ===

The Tobi project currently does not have a public mailing-list.

The best way to stay informed is by using the built-in RSS feeds. Any modern web-browser should support news feeds natively, and of course there are many news-readers available.

For example, the "Timeline" section produces an RSS feed that notifies any change that happens in the Trac environment (Wiki, Tickets, SVN commit, milestones, etc.).

=== Obtaining help ===

The original Trac welcome page is [wiki:TracWelcomePage available here]. Follow the links in there to learn how to use Trac. We provide additional [AccessKeys remarks] regarding accessibility, and more particularly the issue of access keys (keyboard shortcuts).

Please read [wiki:CvsDudeLinks this page] for a list of useful pointers, such as the direct hyperlinks to RSS feeds (which can be added in your favorite news reader).

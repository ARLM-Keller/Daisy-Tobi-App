= Useful Links =

== General ==

 * The main login page: [http://cvsdude.com]
 * ...and a direct link: [https://node8.cvsdude.com/login.pl]

== SVN ==

 * HTTP client (faster): [http://daisy-svn.cvsdude.com/tobi]
 * HTTPS client (more secure): [https://daisy-svn.cvsdude.com/tobi]
 * Commits Mailing-list: [https://node11.cvsdude.com/mlarch/tobi]
 * ViewVC (good old ugly UI, but allows for direct HTML rendering): [https://daisy-browse.cvsdude.com/vvc]
 * WebSVN (pretty, but no direct HTML delivery): [https://daisy-browse.cvsdude.com/wsvn]

=== Direct Checkout ===

''There's a number of URL schemes'':

* with the "view=co" GET HTTP parameter in ViewVC:

https://daisy-browse.cvsdude.com/vvc/tobi/trac/wiki/special/Tobi_Roadmap_Summary.html?view=co

* with special "*checkout*" pseudo-directory in ViewVC (actually redirects to the above URL):

https://daisy-browse.cvsdude.com/vvc/*checkout*/tobi/trac/wiki/special/Tobi_Roadmap_Summary.html

* with the "format=raw" GET HTTP parameter in Trac-browser:

https://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/browser/trac/wiki/special/Tobi_Roadmap_Summary.html?format=raw

''These ones do not work'':

* WebSVN does not seem to have such "checkout" functionality at all:

https://daisy-browse.cvsdude.com/wsvn/wsvn/tobi/trac/wiki/special/Tobi_Roadmap_Summary.html

* the SVN-compliant URL only serves plain-text source:

http://daisy-svn.cvsdude.com/tobi/trac/wiki/special/Tobi_Roadmap_Summary.html 

== Trac ==

 * HTTP browser (faster): [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi]
 * HTTPS browser (more secure): [https://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi]

== Bugzilla ==

There's one instance only for the whole "daisy" project (sub-projects are configured from within the tracker).

 * [https://daisy-bugz.cvsdude.com]

== !WebDav ==

There's one instance only for the whole "daisy" project.

Paste the URL directly in the web-browser, or in supported file !WebDav client (Mac OS X: Finder->Go->"Connect to server").

 * [https://daisy-drive.cvsdude.com/users/daisy]

== RSS feeds ==

When a Trac page contains an RSS feed, an orange icon that says "RSS XML feed" is displayed at the bottom of the page.

The most useful feed is the "Timeline", as it notifies of any changes in the Wiki, SVN repository, Issue Tracker / Tickets and Roadmap / Milestones: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/timeline?changeset=on&wiki=on&ticket=on&ticket_details=on&milestone=on&format=rss]

Here are other examples of direct links:

 * Blog: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/blog?year=2008&format=rss]
 * Active Tickets: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/report/1?format=rss]
 * Revision Log ("/" root of the repository): [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/log/?limit=100&mode=stop_on_copy&format=rss]
 * Revision Log (for the "/trac/" directory): [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/log/trac/?limit=100&mode=stop_on_copy&format=rss]

== Advanced ==

 * It is worth noting that there is a direct mapping between the AdminUpload -> Upload List directory and a public URL. For example: [http://PROJECT-trac.cvsdude.com/MODULE/chrome/uploads/USER/file.ext] is actually stored inside "/var/www/cvsdude/trac/PROJECT/MODULE/uploads/USER/", which is a write-enabled folder for authenticated TRAC_ADMIN users.

 * There is also the "/var/www/cvsdude/trac/PROJECT/MODULE/templates/" directory, but it's used internally by the Trac runtime only, there is no public HTTP URL to access its contents. The configuration also shows "/usr/local/python/share/trac/templates".

 * The CSS and JS files are in the "chrome" directory, e.g.: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/common/css/wiki.css] and [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/common/js/trac.js]. For built-in plugins, there are separate chrome folders, e.g.: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/blog/css/blog.css] and [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/tags/css/tractags.css] and [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/chrome/admin/css/admin.css]

= Tobi Roadmap =

== Overview ==

Tobi is an ambitious software project, with a a relatively aggressive schedule of 2/2.5 years to reach mature state (stable and complete feature set).

The proposed roadmap spans from January 2008 to January 2010, and is (hopefully) an efficient development program covering inception, design and implementation.

Please note that in this plan, the objectives from April 2009 onwards are intentionally under-specified. The rationale is that circumstances may (and probably will) change: product requirements, resources, industry-standards, etc. We will re-assess goals and resources nearer the time.

== Objectives, Project Plan ==

The project plan is available in Trac format, in the [/tobi/roadmap "Roadmap" section]. Alternatively, the milestones and their full deliverable specifications are directly accessible [wiki:TobiPhase1 here].

The staffing requirements are specified for each milestone. In addition, an overall staffing plan is available [wiki:StaffingPlan here].

For your convenience, a summary has been compiled into a single page, and is available [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/browser/trac/wiki/special/Tobi_Roadmap_Summary.html?format=raw here].

== Development Process ==

Details about ''how'' to meet the targets set-out by the above roadmap are [TobiProcess available here].

Some of the resources in this plan are allocated tentatively, i.e.:

 * with FTE estimates to be confirmed for a particular staff member.
 * with well-defined FTE requirements, but no committed assignment yet.

''Note'': Full Time Equivalent (FTE) figures are given for indication only: they are estimates of average over the full project life-time. Resource requirements are detailed on a per-activity basis, in the [wiki:TobiPhase1 roadmap].

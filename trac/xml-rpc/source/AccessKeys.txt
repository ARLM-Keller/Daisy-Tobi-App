== Keyboard Shortcuts ==

An up-to-date list of access keys is documented here:

[http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracAccessibility#content]

== Problems ==

Now, regardless of Trac, there are a number of issues about access-key support in modern web-browsers:

 * the access-key specification itself is flawed, which leads to implementations that differ from one browser to another, and even for one browser on different operating systems.
 * there are often conflicts between shortcuts that are defined at the application or OS level, and shortcuts that are defined inside the web-page. The resolution of these conflicts differ widely from one browser to another. For example, Firefox will execute all actions associated to the key stroke combination (resulting in some funny behaviour, like jumping tabs and disappearing content).
 * Screen-readers for visually-impaired or blind users usually offer an additional level of control over the default user-interface, as they are themselves extremely reliant on keyboard shortcuts. However there are many vendors and versions of screen-readers, which feature-set differ widely. So again, there is no guarantee to make things work uniformly.

To conclude, the current technology has a frustrating limitation: it's impossible to please everyone, as one solution that works for one might result in a usability nightmare for another.

We cannot eliminate this problem until there is a revision of the standard and a uniform implementation across ALL web-browsers, to include a mechanism allowing the user to configure a mapping between logical and hardware keys (XHTML2 Access + Role ?).

== Workaround ==

 * Well, despite the lack of a real solution, we can at least minimize the risk of keyboard shortcut conflict, by avoiding things like "ALT-f" on Windows (which is the usual "File" menu), or "ALT-{1-9}" in Firefox (which switches tabs). Example here: [http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/3217].

 * The default access keys in Trac can be removed using a source code patch (Python), but there is no configuration in the 0.10 branch (only from 0.11, which is currently in beta stage: [http://trac.edgewall.org/changeset/4024]). Here is an example: [http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/2444].

 * When a missing shortcut is missing for an frequently used feature, it's possible to alter the corresponding !ClearSilver template, like shown here: [http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/2444]. However there are some usability issues to consider, such as the risk of submitting/canceling a form because of an involuntary keyboard stroke, see here: [http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/4263].
